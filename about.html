    <p>=>    If one does not like to work with exercise machines, but still likes to exercise, gyms also offer group exercises which includes boot camp exercises they do in teams, cycling sessions on stationary bicycles, martial arts exercises like body combat, boxing, etc. and plenty of dance routines like Zumba, HipHop, Ballroom Dancing, etc. It can be very fun and meet new people so social life becomes alive.<br><br>
       =>    When one exercises, the heart becomes stronger so it is efficient in pumping blood to the body so vital organs are kept healthy and in order. For example, blood pressure is maintained instead of spike high, cholesterol and triglyceride levels are kept low and heart disease is kept at bay. It means there is less chances of having a heart attack or stroke or any other diseases when one exercises regularly.

    <p>=>   If one thinks over-exercising will curb their appetite so they become slim sooner, they are wrong. Andersen also says it can lead to overeating because oneâ€™s appetite is stimulated more if it the body requires more energy to sustain its exertion in exercise, so the more exercise one does, the bigger his appetite.<br><br>
        =>  As in everything else, too much of something good is bad, and in the case of over-exercising, it can lead to burnout. This means one has gone beyond his limits and the body is not able to handle it. The person may have a breakdown, get sick and becomes unable to exercise, work or be in any way productive. So it is much better to stick with an exercise program that is manageable at a time period that one can handle. That is about 30 minutes to an hour everyday of moderate exercise coupled with a good diet plan.
